# yadiskClient

Yandex.Disk iOS Application with advanced functionality using Yandex.Disk REST API. (Works with iOS 12.4 and below)
It was made as a course project, when I was in the 3rd year of university.

### Advanced functionality
- Full access to your public folders 
- Access to other's people public folders via link
- Full access to the Trash

### Problems
- You can't open and preview any files except images and videos
- On new iOS versions it crashes because of new Swift standarts
